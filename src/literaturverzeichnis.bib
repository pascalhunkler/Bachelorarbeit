	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for enforcing incompressibility for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) by preserving uniform density across the domain. We propose a hybrid method that uses a Poisson solve on a coarse grid to enforce a divergence free velocity ﬁeld, followed by a local density correction of the particles. This avoids typical grid artifacts and maintains the Lagrangian nature of SPH by directly transferring pressures onto particles. Our method can be easily integrated with existing SPH techniques such as the incompressible PCISPH method as well as weakly compressible SPH by adding an additional force term. We show that this hybrid method accelerates convergence towards uniform density and permits a signiﬁcantly larger time step compared to earlier approaches while producing similar results. We demonstrate our approach in a variety of scenarios with signiﬁcant pressure gradients such as splashing liquids.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel formulation of the projection method for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We combine a symmetric SPH pressure force and an SPH discretization of the continuity equation to obtain a discretized form of the pressure Poisson equation (PPE). In contrast to previous projection schemes, our system does consider the actual computation of the pressure force. This incorporation improves the convergence rate of the solver. Furthermore, we propose to compute the density deviation based on velocities instead of positions as this formulation improves the robustness of the time-integration scheme. We show that our novel formulation outperforms previous projection schemes and state-of-the-art SPH methods. Large time steps and small density deviations of down to 0.01\% can be handled in typical scenarios. The practical relevance of the approach is illustrated by scenarios with up to 40 million SPH particles.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several ‘urban myths’ regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the ‘neighbour number’ more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the ﬁrst public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/ SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) implementation algorithm on GPUs. To compute a force on a particle, neighboring particles have to be searched. However, implementation of a neighboring particle search on GPUs is not straightforward. We developed a method that can search for neighboring particles on GPUs, which enabled us to implement the SPH simulation entirely on GPUs. Since all of the computation is done on GPUs and no CPU processing is needed, the proposed algorithm can exploit the massive computational power of GPUs. Consequently, the simulation speed is many times increased with the proposed method.},

	abstract = {An incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is presented to simulate Newtonian and non-Newtonian ﬂows with free surfaces. The basic equations solved are the incompressible mass conservation and Navier–Stokes equations. The method uses prediction–correction fractional steps with the temporal velocity ﬁeld integrated forward in time without enforcing incompressibility in the prediction step. The resulting deviation of particle density is then implicitly projected onto a divergence-free space to satisfy incompressibility through a pressure Poisson equation derived from an approximate pressure projection. Various SPH formulations are employed in the discretization of the relevant gradient, divergence and Laplacian terms. Free surfaces are identiﬁed by the particles whose density is below a set point. Wall boundaries are represented by particles whose positions are ﬁxed. The SPH formulation is also extended to non-Newtonian ﬂows and demonstrated using the Cross rheological model. The incompressible SPH method is tested by typical 2-D dam-break problems in which both water and ﬂuid mud are considered. The computations are in good agreement with available experimental data. The diﬀerent ﬂow features between Newtonian and nonNewtonian ﬂows after the dam-break are discussed.},

	abstract = {Realistically animated ﬂuids can add substantial realism to interactive applications such as virtual surgery simulators or computer games. In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate ﬂuids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the SPH-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards ﬂuid simulation by deriving the force density ﬁelds directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the ﬂuid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},
